Another redesign project went live recently: American Cycle Supply. The task was to redesign site's header, to make it less brutal, but still in the biker's style. That's what it is now:

<a href="../res/images/projects/ACS/ACS012.jpg" title="ACS012.jpg" rel="floatbox" rev="width:1196 height:820 scrolling:no theme:white hideFlash:true caption:`ACS.jpg` showHints:never">
        <div class="image_part ">
        <div>
            <img src="../res/images/projects/ACS/ACS1.jpg" title="" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <div class="cl_b"></div>
    </div>
</a>

And that's what it was before:

<img src="../res/images/projects/ACS/ACS%2Dold.jpg?&amp;width=512" width="512" alt="ACS-old.jpg" title="ACS-old.jpg"/>

</div></div>
