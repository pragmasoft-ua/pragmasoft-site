h1. Android Mobile Client

*Technologies:* AndroidSDK

"Vyke Technologies":http://www.vyke.com/ has just released *Android Mobile Client*, its development was covered by Pragmasoft. It lets you make international calls from an Android phone way cheaper. It supports Vyke "Callback":http://www.vyke.com/help/mobile-explained.jsf#mobile-callback and "Callthough":http://www.vyke.com/help/mobile-explained.jsf#mobile-callthrough" features. To make a call, you should open Android Mobile client and select the number you like to call. Click Call in Mobile Client, and your phone connects to the Vyke server via GPRS/EDGE/3G to make a call. So within seconds you get connected to the destination phone.

Android Mobile Client's great advantage that it has *call interception* feature: if you dial an international number on your phone it will automatically be made through Vyke Mobile Client rather then through your mobile provider.

With Vyke Android Mobile Client you can:

*(star) Enable „Register“ or „Log on“ to Vyke in client
* View available Vyke account balance in client
* Make Callthrough and Callback calls
* Enable client to access and use Android address book
