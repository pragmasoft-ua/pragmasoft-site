This project was to make a dynamic, relational database driven web site that used J2EE and servlets. "KonaKart":http://www.konakart.com/ was chosen to be integrated as shopping cart software solution. The entire site (web application + KonaKart) was  implemented on Tomcat standalone. We used the best practices for search engine optimization (SEO) and security.
