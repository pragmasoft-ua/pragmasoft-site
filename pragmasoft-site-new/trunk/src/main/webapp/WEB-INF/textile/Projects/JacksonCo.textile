As special as it is, this project is remembered with us for the most numerous count of revisions and drafts. Check our blog to see the evolution of designs we went through before we came to the final variant.

So the task was: to develop a bright, creative design for a e-store dealing with industrial, cleaning, maintenance and food service goods. The scope of service is wide, so it was challenging to come up with a single concept of design to get the idea of JacksonCo Supply across. But as you know, there is not such word as 'impossible' for Pragmasoft: we pulled all our creativity together and started brainstorming and drafting.

We had a number of nice ideas from the design perspective that were unfortunately turned down. That's the concept that we find exceptionally successful, but that was not accepted:

Applying trial and error method, we have finally reached the variant to satisfy our client's needs:

All in all, JacksonCo Supply gave us a nice challenge to overcome: we have worked side by side with the customer to find the best solution for the logo, site design, Flash banner concept and animation. And we proudly present the current project for your attention.
