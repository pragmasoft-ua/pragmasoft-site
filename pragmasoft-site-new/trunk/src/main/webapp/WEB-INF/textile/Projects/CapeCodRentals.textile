<div class="content"><div class="desc">*Scope:* web design, UI optimization, XHTMl/CSS, Javascript banner rotator

That's the original design for Cape Cod Rentals site. We strove to fill the design with a feel of ocean, Cape Cod atmosphere - sandy texture on the background, nice ocean views on the pics, that are smoothly interchanged by Javascript; the latest trends in web design'08 are incorporated in the web design as well - paper textured background, paper clips, the piled pictures effect, etc.

Pragmasoft was as well responsible for HTML/CSS slicing for the project. Javascript effects to appear on the site are as well our contributions.
