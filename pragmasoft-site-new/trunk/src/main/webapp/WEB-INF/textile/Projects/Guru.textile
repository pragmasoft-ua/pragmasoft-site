h1. Gurus Way

Within Gurus Way project Pragmasoft developed a logo and a layout for a travel tips site. The task was to implement bellied Buddha in the design, and make the design in eastern style, which would at the same time spell the idea of traveling.

We started with the logo design:

!../res/images/projects/Guru/GurusWaylogo.jpg!

And here's the web design that we came up with, after the logo was approved:

%(zoom#ex3)!{width:512px;height:473px}../res/images/projects/Guru/GurusWay01.jpg!%

It looks nice, doesn't it?
