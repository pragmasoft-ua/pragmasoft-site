h1. Close Friends

Close Friends social network was designed to accumulate the best features of modern social networking sites. And since nice design guarantees about 40% of the project success, we gathered all our creativity to come up with something really outstanding. First we developed a nice looking logo, showing a variety of moods of literally close cartoon characters. And after a couple of design drafts, we came up with the final web design that was approved:

And here's the design for the inner page:
