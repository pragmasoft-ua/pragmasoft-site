Great project! Great results! Great customers! Great realization of the design! It's nice to come up with some result that you are truly proud of. mySportSite project is exactly the case. Please revise the final results that we came up with and share our excitement with us. In terms of mySportSite project we have worked on:

*Logo design*: The task was to develop a logo that would convey team spirit, competition, energy, high tension when the game score are tied up at the very final stages of the game, youth, passion for sports, but this logo should not have any direct link to any specific sports. This was a challenging task and in the end we came up with a solution to meet this criteria. We should admit it was a long way to come to the final variant. To see the most worthy variants that we developed in the process of our creative search, please see "our blog post":/Blog/MySPortSiteGiving110

*Web Site* design: The design on site went faster. See "our blog post":/Blog/mySportSitedesigningwebsite for some other variants of the current page.

*Handout* print ad deisgn: Since MSS is working with muslitple sports, we were to come up with 2 types of print ad designs: general for field sports, and one specific for hockey, since hockey takes major part of the current customers of MSS. 
We designed one handout in 2 versions. One of more general character, to fit most summer sports:
