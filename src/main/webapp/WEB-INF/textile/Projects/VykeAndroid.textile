"Vyke Technologies":http://www.vyke.com/ has just released *Android Mobile Client*, its development was covered by Pragmasoft. It lets you make international calls from an Android phone way cheaper. It supports Vyke "Callback":http://www.vyke.com/help/mobile-explained.jsf#mobile-callback and "Callthough":http://www.vyke.com/help/mobile-explained.jsf#mobile-callthrough" features. To make a call, you should open Android Mobile client and select the number you like to call. Click Call in Mobile Client, and your phone connects to the Vyke server via GPRS/EDGE/3G to make a call. So within seconds you get connected to the destination phone.
