*Faster Programmers* is a software engineering consulting company that specializes in the agile development of high-performance architectures.

The task was to create a design template to fit the %(wikiexternallink)<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Garden HTML template</a>%, and style it within the means of CSS only. Logo design was included in the project as well. That's the result of of our work:

<img src="../res/images/projects/FP/Fasterprogrammers4.jpg?&amp;width=500" width="500" alt="Fasterprogrammers4.jpg" title="Fasterprogrammers4.jpg"/>

<img src="../res/images/projects/FP/Fasterprogrammers5.jpg?&amp;width=300" width="300" alt="Fasterprogrammers5.jpg" title="Fasterprogrammers5.jpg"/>

Note that for both desktop and iPhone version of the site we used the same HTML code, only CSS fies are different.
