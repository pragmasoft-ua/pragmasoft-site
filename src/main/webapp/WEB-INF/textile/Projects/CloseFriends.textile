h1. Close Friends

<div class="content"><div class="desc">Close Friends social network was designed to accumulate the best features of modern social networking sites. And since nice design guarantees about 40% of the project success, we gathered all our creativity to come up with something really outstanding. First we developed a nice looking logo, showing a variety of moods of literally close cartoon characters. And after a couple of design drafts, we came up with the final web design that was approved: 

<a href="../res/images/projects/CloseFriends/CloseFriendsStart.jpg" title="CloseFriendsStart.jpg" rel="floatbox" rev="width:1200 height:700 scrolling:no theme:white hideFlash:true caption:`Close Freinds` showHints:never">
   	<div class="image_part ">
        <div>
            <img src="../res/images/projects/CloseFriends/Closefriends1.jpg" title="" alt=""/>
        </div>
    <div class="cl_b"></div>
    </div>
</a>

And here's the design for the inner page:

<a href="../res/images/projects/CloseFriends/CloseFriends514.jpg" title="CloseFriends514.jpg" rel="floatbox" rev="width:1200 height:800 scrolling:no theme:white hideFlash:true caption:`Close Freinds` showHints:never">
   	<div class="image_part ">
        <div>
            <img src="../res/images/projects/CloseFriends/Closefriends10.jpg" title="" alt=""/>
        </div>
    <div class="cl_b"></div>
    </div>
</a>
